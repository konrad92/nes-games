=========

My NES open source games projects compiled and linked by cc65 compiler under Win8. Written partially in 6502 ASM and C with custom CRT library.

### CC65
The cc65 compiler documentation and binaries can be found under: http://cc65.github.io/cc65/

### NES
NES documentation that i'm using: http://nesdev.com Nice one, well-written tutorials can be found either http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=7155

### Under Development
* Preview version with working (and i guess well-written) custom CRT library.
* Still needs more library commits for nicier functionality.

### Examples
Soon.
